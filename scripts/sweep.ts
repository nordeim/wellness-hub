// Session-92 (S92-P5): the ZERO-DATA SCREENSHOT-DIFF SWEEP — the s91
// session's strong-sweep methodology promoted into the repo as a
// ONE-COMMAND regression (the s91 first-listed suggested next).
//
// What it does (bun run sweep):
//   1. boots (or reuses) the dev server on :3000
//   2. drives OUR app to the ZERO-DATA state — the reference's own
//      standing state (its workspace has been empty for 13 censuses) —
//      via scripts/zero-data.ts (the s91 tool, reused not duplicated;
//      users + the Setting singleton stay functional)
//   3. resolves the CROSS-PROCESS auth pair state
//      (scripts/sweep-state.ts — the 162-c login consolidation: the
//      first invocation pays the login pair and writes the state file,
//      the next invocations reuse it while fresh; ZERO logins on a
//      reuse), captures the PAGES list per app at the given viewport
//      (default 1440x900; the reference's Base44 badge closed,
//      content-waits per page — the shell's main, or the not-found
//      entry's h1-404 override since session-197)
//   4. pairwise pixel-diffs each page (per-channel tolerance 12, the
//      s91 value) — the PNGs decode in a browser canvas (getImageData);
//      the PURE diffPixels seam is the same function the unit pins
//      exercise in node. ZERO new dependencies.
//   5. prints the % table + restores the seed (bun run db:seed)
//
// The standing EXPLAINED diffs (do not treat as drift):
//   settings ~4.7%  the picklist-DATA genus (the reference's picklists
//                    wiped with its workspace, ours seeded)
//   landing  ~9.6%  the s142 brand-token genus (the reference's CSS
//                    build dropped its brand utilities — its CTAs
//                    render invisible; ours the working blue)
//   login    ~0.28% the brand-mark logo genus (constant-absolute px)
// Session-146 (the baselines re-derivation): the s91-era contacts
//   ~0.5% (the "lucide superset + noise") and dashboard ~0.3% (the 2px
//   chart-baseline artifact) genera are RETIRED — contacts 0.00 and
//   dashboard 0.03 at the s142–s146 gates alike (the s91 comment
//   misattributed the DOM-level N-89c6 aria-hidden superset to a pixel
//   diff; the artifact left with the s139/s142 chart re-derivations).
// Every other page ran 0.00-0.01% at the s91/s92 ships. The tool is a
// drift REPORT (exit 0 with the table); pass --max-diff <pct> (the
// space-separated form — the one the parser reads) to gate
// a threshold CI-style (exit 1 when any page exceeds it).
//
// The PHONE-WIDTH standing table (session-94 maiden run, 390x844 —
// the first phone sweep): a uniform ~0.5% floor on EVERY page (the
// mobile-nav superset topbar genus — ours renders [hamburger LEFT] +
// [account RIGHT], the reference [account LEFT] alone; the displaced
// account glyphs + the hamburger ≈ 1600 px ≈ 0.49% of the 390x844
// frame) · settings ~7.3% (the same picklist genus, a LARGER share of
// the narrower frame) · reports ~0.7% (the floor + chart noise). The
// desktop table above still governs the default run.
//
// Run: bun run sweep   (or: bun scripts/sweep.ts)
//   Phone-width mode (session-94, the s93 suggested next — the 390px
//   rotation method productized): bun run sweep -- --width 390
//   --height 844. The shots land in a viewport-tagged subfolder
//   (sweep-shots/w390x844/) so a phone run never collides with the
//   desktop shots; the diff table is computed fresh per run either way.
//   Targeted runs (session-95, the s94 suggested next): add
//   --pages leads,settings to sweep a comma-separated SUBSET of the
//   PAGES list (both the captures and the diffs); unknown names fail
//   fast listing the valid names.
//   Threshold gate: --max-diff <pct> (space-separated — the parsed
//   form; exit 1 when any page exceeds it).
//   Per-page drift gate (session-96, the s95 suggested next #2):
//   --fail-on-drift exits 1 when any page exceeds ITS OWN standing
//   baseline + margin (default 0.5pct; override --drift-margin <pct>) —
//   a 0.00% page drifting to 5% fails here where a global --max-diff 8
//   (which must sit above the settings genus) never could.
//   The diff-clustering decode (session-100, the twice-suggested
//   promotion — the s98 suggested next #2, re-suggested at s99): add
//   --clusters to decode each page's diff into BUCKETS — clustered
//   regions of differing pixels (a coarse-grid union-find, cell =
//   --cluster-gap px [default 16]; clusters closer than ~gap px merge)
//   each reported with its bbox, pixel count, share of the page's
//   diff, and share of the frame (top 5 per page, biggest first).
//   The genus hunts ran this decode as one-off probes since s95 (the
//   F-99c1 rail-band decode); now it is one flag. Pure decode output —
//   the gate semantics are unchanged.
//   The baseline classes (session-99, the 4-way md/lg/xl banding —
//   the s97 3-way grown by the maiden landscape run):
//   < 768 the PHONE table (both walked widths 390x844 + 375x812) ·
//   < 1024 the TABLET table (the maiden 768x1024 run — the accounts
//   0.72% overflow genus, the reference's bare flex-1 poke-out vs our
//   min-w-0 in-box scroll) · < 1280 the LANDSCAPE table (the maiden
//   1024x768 run — the same overflow genus at its lg-band share: the
//   reference's bare flex-1 content FLOORS at its table's min-content,
//   SQUEEZES its own w-80 rail 320->183, and pokes main +6px; ours
//   the min-w-0 in-box scroll + the full 320 rail) · else DESKTOP. A
//   width in an un-walked band is judged by its class table; run a
//   maiden sweep before trusting a new band.
//   Numeric flags fail fast (session-97, B-97a2): a missing or
//   non-numeric --width/--height/--max-diff/--drift-margin value
//   throws listing the expected form — NaN must never silently disarm
//   a gate. The `gate:full` package script chains the standing gate +
//   all four drift sweeps.
// Env:  OUR_URL (default http://localhost:3000)

// are SEPARATE PROCESSES, so the per-invocation pre-flight form cannot
// cure this seam — each process would still pay its own login. The
// cure is the shared state FILE (scripts/.sweep-auth-state.json, the
// combined pair state — two origins one jar): the chain's our-login
// count drops 4 -> 1 (L-160c1: the count is the budget's true axis —
// never the arrival rate). The guards: a 15-min TTL (the login-window
// semantics — reuse within one chain) + the authenticated probe
// (validation-by-use: both apps' /dashboard must not redirect to
// /login; any miss self-heals through the fresh login pair — the
// stateless cookie license is L-160c2). The file follows the
// db-binary discipline: git-ignored, 0600, TTL-bounded (L-162c3).
