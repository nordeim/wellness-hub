`session_4.md` records my session-202, and `remediation_plan_v2.md` is a **dummy placeholder** — the owner's directive: create a real, validated, versioned remediation plan. Let me see what the owner removed from the worklog:
The picture is now clear. The owner's commits:
1. **Pruned the worklog** (removed session-198/199 entries, keeping 200–202)
2. **`docs/session_4.md`** = my session-202 record
3. **`docs/remediation_plan_v2.md`** = a **dummy placeholder** with the directive: *"create validated remediation plan with versioning for each iteration session"*

This round's headline deliverable is a **real, validated, versioned remediation plan**. Let me set up the session plan:
Let me kick off the baseline gates and read the audit skill in parallel:
Baseline green on `4de2217` (lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 498/498 · census MATCH). Now reading the audit-relevant skill sections:
Skills internalized. Now the audit — targeting areas not yet swept in prior rounds (dependency health, fresh-clone posture, PAD known-issues register, the dormant toolchain, the AI seam):
`bun audit` shows **10 advisories (4 high / 5 moderate / 1 low)** — and the PAD §10 ledger has **no advisories census row** (the family doctrine requires it). Critically, `zod <4.6.6` is a **runtime** dependency. Let me get the full picture:
The zod finding decodes: runtime `zod@4.6.7` is **safe** (≥4.6.6); the advisory resolves through `eslint-config-next › eslint-plugin-react-hooks` — a **dev-toolchain chain**. All 10 advisories are dev-toolchain (eslint/prisma CLI/vitest/postcss). But the family's security-ledger doctrine (PAD §10 census + dormancy decode + re-triage clause) is **missing** for wealth-os. Continuing the audit — fresh-clone posture and the toolchain state:
README quickstart ordering is correct (`cp` before db commands). Sweep toolchain confirmed CRM-era. Checking the remaining audit legs — env contract match and the vitest env posture:
Found another item: `vitest.config.ts` carries a CRM-era header comment. Let me sweep all config files for scaffold-era staleness:
All configs are clean apart from the two findings. The AI seam matches ADR-005. Let me check the existing pin-test inventory to place the security-ledger cure surgically:
No `docs-counts.test.ts` exists — but AGENTS.md names it in its pinned-contracts list. Verifying:
Confirmed: **AGENTS.md + PAD reference a phantom `docs-counts` pin** (a neo-crm artifact never ported to wealth-os) — and the PAD's gate line still says **497 unit** (stale since D-201c added the 498th). This is live doc-rot, exactly what the docs-counts pin exists to prevent. Let me map every live-tense count claim in the living docs:
The doc-rot map is precise: **5 live-tense sites carry the stale 497** (CLAUDE:47, README:224, PAD:669, PAD:702, SKILL:9) while SKILL:1104 is legitimate history. Let me check the README badge arithmetic too (497+84=581 → now stale):
README badge also stale (581 → 582). The findings ledger is complete. Let me check the capture-script pattern for this round's evidence, then write the plan:
Pattern internalized. Now writing the headline deliverable — the real, validated, versioned remediation plan (replacing the dummy):
Plan shipped as draft. Now executing **R-2** (docs-counts port, the genuine RED→GREEN cycle). First, the house idiom for reading repo files in tests:
House idiom clear. Writing the docs-counts pin — RED at birth against the stale sites:
**Perfect RED: 6 failed / 1 passed** — exactly the six stale sites, and the phantom-reference check green. Now the GREEN step — fixing the six doc sites:
All six sites fixed. Confirming GREEN:
**R-2 GREEN (7/7).** Now **R-1** — the security ledger. Writing the pin file first (PAD row pin RED at birth; zod floor pin green at birth, mutation-proven after):
As designed: zod pin **GREEN at birth** (runtime 4.6.7 clears the floor), PAD census pin **RED**. Now the GREEN step — adding the advisories row + re-triage clause to PAD §10. First let me see the pin-inventory row I need to update too:
PAD §7.1 also carries counts (another stale site: "Unit | 35 | 497"). Now the R-1 GREEN edits — the §10 advisories row + re-triage clause:
Now the AGENTS.md duty line (R-1's third piece):
R-1 pieces in place. Verifying GREEN + getting the real unit count for the lockstep pass:
**R-1 GREEN (2/2) · full suite: 37 files / 507 tests.** Now the count-lockstep pass — the real total is 507 (badge 591). Updating the pin constants first (RED), then all doc sites (GREEN):
RED confirmed across all 7 sites. GREEN pass — updating every doc site to the live totals (507 unit · 591 badge · 37 files):
All sites updated. But adding the §7.1 pin grew docs-counts to 8 tests — the total likely moved again. Running to get ground truth, and applying R-3 (vitest.config comment) first:
Ground truth: **508** (the §7.1 pin itself added one). Final lockstep pass — 508 everywhere:
**508/508 GREEN — lockstep converged.** Now the mutation-proof of the zod floor pin (teeth verification):
**Mutation-proven**: floor raised → exactly 1 RED with evidence → restored → GREEN. R-1/R-2/R-3 complete. Now lint + typecheck on the new code, then the plan's execution-record update:
Clean. Now updating the plan's execution record with the real gate numbers and wiring the doc cross-references:
The R-2 narrative needs the final-state correction (the counts landed at 508/592 after the pin's own tests joined the total):
Now wiring the plan into the doc set — AGENTS "Where things live", CLAUDE's ANALYZE list, README:
Doc cross-references wired. Running the remaining full-gate legs — build, smoke, e2e (unit re-verified after doc edits):
**FULL GATE GREEN: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 508/508 unit · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 84/84.** Now the screenshot evidence — checking the authenticated-capture pattern first:
Writing the session-203 capture script and running it against the dev server:
The KPI label guess failed — checking what the dashboard actually renders:
Real labels: "Monthly Income / Monthly Expenses / Net Balance / Savings Rate". Fixing the assertion:
Captures verified (dashboard 36.5% non-white with live-asserted KPIs; drawer 99.4% with 9 nav links asserted). Server down. Final lint/tsc pass to cover the new capture script, then the worklog entry:
All clean. Writing the session-203 worklog entry:
Worklog in. Pre-commit secrets scan, then the commit sequence:
The only hits are the seed's public demo credentials — already committed at `scripts/captures-199.ts:9-10` and documented in README's "Verify setup" (not secret material). Proceeding with the commit sequence:
Four commits on main, tree clean. Final unit sanity on the committed tree, then the SSH push:
Session 203 complete — pushed and verified at `badc0db` == remote main, key shredded, tree clean.

## What this round delivered

**The headline: `docs/remediation_plan_v2.md`** — the owner's dummy placeholder is now the real versioned program: a `v2.N.M` versioning contract (N bumps per executing session, every session appends an execution-history row in the same commit), a six-finding audit ledger with file:line evidence, and an R-item program with entry/exit criteria.

**The audit** (skills-guided, all findings verified) found:
- **F-203a**: the security ledger was never ported — `bun audit`'s 10 advisories (all dev-toolchain, zero runtime chains) recorded nowhere; the zod advisory's runtime safety was an accident, not a contract
- **F-203b/c**: AGENTS/PAD referenced a phantom `docs-counts` pin that never existed — and its absence had live consequences: **six doc sites stale at 497/581** for two sessions
- Plus the dormant `gate:full` toolchain (programmed as R-4 for sessions 204+), the vitest.config CRM comment (R-3), and the by-design AI seam (R-5, on demand)

**Executed with TDD (R-1/R-2/R-3)**: the security ledger (mutation-proven runtime-zod floor pin + PAD census pin + re-triage doctrine) and the docs-counts lockstep port — genuinely RED at birth against the stale sites, with totals re-converging to **508 unit / 592 badge** as the pin's own tests joined the suite. The phantom reference was cured by building the named artifact.

**Gate**: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · **508/508 unit** · build · smoke 14/14 · **84/84 e2e** · census MATCH — plus two live-asserted screenshot captures and full docs lockstep.

**Next iteration (session 204)** per the plan: **R-4.1** — re-anchor `sweep.ts` to the WealthOS reference, the first step of the `gate:full` re-derivation.
