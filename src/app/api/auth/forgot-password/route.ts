/**
 * POST /api/auth/forgot-password — session-163 (the digma S46/S64/S66/
 * S124 port): the reset-request half of the password-reset funnel. The
 * login card's "Forgot password?" view had been CLIENT-SIDE THEATER since
 * session 11 (the reference app's own demo rendered the sent card from
 * pure client state — no network call fired); this endpoint gives the
 * flow its server half.
 *
 * The no-enumeration contract: the same 200 + message whether or not the
 * account exists (digma's RA-65 measured text). The token is a 32-byte
 * crypto-random hex with a 60-minute TTL. The SELF-HOSTED in-app delivery
 * (the digma ADR-014 family): the resetUrl rides along for existing
 * accounts so the demo flow works end-to-end without a mail transport —
 * WELLNESS_DISABLE_IN_APP_RESET=1 nulls it for production (an email service
 * owns the delivery); the no-enumeration 200 and its message are
 * unchanged either way, and the client's sent card degrades gracefully
 * (it renders the link only when the field is a string).
 *
 * The URL is RELATIVE on purpose (digma's e2e trace caught the absolute
 * form breaking the standalone deploy): Next's standalone server rebuilds
 * request.url from its BIND address, so an absolute href yielded
 * http://0.0.0.0:3100 — a host Chrome refuses cookies on. A relative
 * href resolves against the page's own origin everywhere.
